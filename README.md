A phrase appears at the top of the screen with the character to be typed underlined.
There is a keyboard beneath.

When a key is pressed, that key is animated on the keyboard. 
If the pressed key is the charcater that should be typed, it turns black in the text above the keyboard and the next character is then underlined.
When the phrases is typed out, the phrases switch.
The keyboard highlights red the keys that should be pressed next. 
When shift is clicked, the keyboard is uppercased.

I improved a functionality that when an upper case letter should be typed, both the shift key and that letter are highlighted red.
